### Workshop Overview

- We will be going through a PowerPoint presentation with instructions on how to complete each task. Then, we will be placing you in teams to work through the tasks, aiming to get as many done as you're able. Don't worry about trying to complete them all, just attempting the tasks is great! We will be running a live demonstration throughout, so hopefully you won't get too lost, but if you do please do reach out to any of our mentors who will be happy to help you out with any problems. Once the project has been complete, our mentors will be looking over all of them will decide a winning team. This will be based on our favourite design, so be creative with your solutions!
